# Bank-Accounts

Run the three test classes. 

For this project, I show my knowledge of two Bag ADT's (arrays and linked lists).  To start, I created a new class called BankAccount as well as two subclasses, CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount.  These classes are the blueprints for the objects we will be interacting with in our arrays and linked lists.  The array data type can be tested with the ArrayBagTest java file which adds and deletes bank accounts to and from an array.  The linked list data type can be tested with the LinkedBagTest java file and is similar to the arrays.  Finally, the ExtraCreditTest file runs a user interface for the user to create, store, and check bank accounts.
